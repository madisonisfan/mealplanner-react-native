# Mealplanner - React Native

In 2020 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack bootcamp. In the 3rd course, we created mobile apps with React Native. This project was my submission for the course. 

As part of the React course, I created an web app to go along with this mobile app. [View app repository here](https://github.com/madisonisfan/mealplanner-react)

## My Inspiration
For almost my entire life I've had a passion for health and fitness. Like most people, I found it difficult to find healthy foods that I enjoy and to stay consistent with healthy eating. My goal is to create a place for people to go where they can organize their weekly meal plans, and be motivated by the app community. To help with finding food options for everyone, I created a feature that allows anyone to add a recipe. With everyone adding recipes, there would be an extensive list of food.
